# Building images in CI

See: http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/deployment/methods/images/#deploying-an-image-from-ci

*The dokku server should not be running image builds as this negatively affects runtime performance of running apps.*

Instead you should build the image on an external system (like Ci) and publish the built image to dokku before deploying.

If you're using GitHub, you can use GitHub actions to achieve this.

## Deploying with GitHub Actions

GitHub actions can be used to build the app image and deploy it.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a SSH keypair created (without a passphrase) to allow the GitHub Action runner to SSH to the dokku server.

On your dokku server:

```bash
ssh-keygen -N "" -f /root/.ssh/githubactions
```

Add the `githubactions` public key to authorized_keys:

```bash
cat /root/.ssh/githubactions.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Setting up the GitHub Action workflow

#### Secrets

Create the following secrets in your GitHub repo:

- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` (the contents of `/root/.ssh/githubactions`)
- `DOKKU_HOST` (the hostname of your dokku server)
- `DOKKU_APP_NAME` (the name of the dokku app you want to deploy)

#### Workflow

Create a file called `.github/workflows/publish.yml` in your repo with the following contents:

```yml
name: Publish
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    name: Publish
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup SSH
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh
          echo "${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}" | tr -d '\r' > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
          chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
          ssh-keyscan ${{ secrets.DOKKU_HOST }} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
      - name: Build docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t dokku/${{ secrets.DOKKU_APP_NAME }}:latest .
      - name: Deploy app
        run: |
          docker save dokku/${{ secrets.DOKKU_APP_NAME }}:latest | ssh root@${{ secrets.DOKKU_HOST }} "docker load | dokku tags:deploy ${{ secrets.DOKKU_APP_NAME }} latest"
```

The workflow is triggered whenever you create a new GitHub Release. Once triggered, it builds the docker image, deploys it to the dokku server, then deploys the app.
